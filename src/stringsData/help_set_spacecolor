                       spacecolor[(+|-}<axis>]  (color with opacity)

          Allow to assign color to any point in the space.
             It is used to draw the vertices and edges.

            Without axis, it is the color of the origin.
              With axis, it is the color of hyperplane,
 which is orthogonal to the axis and goes through the (+|-)1 on it.

     Color of a point is the linear combination of the set ones.
