                            campos<axis>  (real number)

         The position of the camera in the specified axis.
           Axis is from 3 to the dimension of the space.
The distance is offset by the zoom to make the unit sphere visible.
            Figure becomes smaller to fit in the sphere.

                           camposl<axis>  (real number)

                   The same as the previous one,
                    but in a logarithmic scale.
             It reflects better the difference between
              perspective and orthographic projection.
