                    rmap <key> [<axis1> <axis2>]

             Assign the plane of rotation to the key or
          unassign previous one if axes are not specified.

       The key can be an ASCII character or <[c][a][s]-key>,
where the pre-hyphen characters are the modifiers Ctrl, Alt, Shift.

                    The axes are indexed from 1.
                     Axis 1 goes to the right,
                         axis 2 goes up,
             axis 3 and every next go to the camera.
                  The order of the axes matters.
                     The angle is in degrees.

  The figure will be rotating all the time the key is being held.
