                           rmap <event> [<axis1> <axis2>]

              Assigns the plane of rotation to the long-lasting event or
                  unassigns previous one if axes are not specified.

             The event can be an ASCII character or <[c][a][s]-key>,
         where the pre-hyphen characters are the modifiers Ctrl, Alt, Shift.
          Key can be also ASCII character or one of enter, esc, bs, delete,
             up, down, left, right, home, end, pageup, pagedown, insert,
                             f1..f12, mouse0..mouse9.
                 Mouse buttons are numbered according to freeglut,
it would be 0 left, 1 center, 2 right, 3/4 vertical wheel, 5/6 horizontal wheel, ...
     The figure is being rotated while the key (with modifiers) is being held.
                 (use :set speed for setting the angular velocity)

The event can also be mouse axis with specified modifiers and mouse buttons pressed:
               <[c][a][s]-mouse[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9](x|y)>.
                    At least one mouse button has to be pressed.
The figure is being rotated while the mouse is moving (holding modifiers and buttons).
                 (use :set mousesens for setting mouse sensitivity)

                            The axes are indexed from 1.
                             Axis 1 goes to the right,
                                 axis 2 goes up,
                     axis 3 and every next go to the camera.
                          The order of the axes matters.
                             The angle is in degrees.
