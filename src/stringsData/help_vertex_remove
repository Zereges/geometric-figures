                         vert[ex] r[e]m[ove]

                     Remove the selected vertex.

              If convexhull is set, it is recalculated,
                otherwise incident faces are removed,
the view will be then split into several figures of lower dimension.
            If the view consists of more than one figure,
              incident figures (not faces) are removed.
