help:python figure;help:scripting figure
These functions allows you to access figures
including their topology.

gf.figureGet()
  Returns the currently opened figure.
gf.figureOpen(figure)
gf.figureOpen(figure, preserveRotation)
  Opens the given figure,
  optionally with preserving rotation (treated as modification).

The figure structure:
  [
    [ (vertex1_x, vertex1_y, ...), ...],       # list of vertices
    [ [edge1_vert1, edge1_vert2], ...],        # list of edges
    [ [face1_edge1, face1_edge2, ...], ...],   # list of faces
    ...                                        # lists of higher-dim faces
  ]
figure[d][i]
  d=0: Tuple of coordinates of i-th vertex.
  d>0: List of indices of (d-1)-dimensional faces in figure[dim-1]
       bounding i-th d-dimensional face.
