help:map
               map <key> [<command_or_python_expr>]

        Assigns the command or python expression to the key
       or unassigns previous one if command is not specified.

       The key can be an ASCII character or <[c][a][s]-key>,
where the pre-hyphen characters are the modifiers Ctrl, Alt, Shift.

      If the second parameter is not recognized as a command,
                it is treated as python expression.
                 No error is raised at this point.
