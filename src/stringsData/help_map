                       map <event> [<command_or_python_expr>]

               Assigns the command or python expression to the event
               or unassigns previous one if command is not specified.

             The event can be an ASCII character or <[c][a][s][r]-key>,
         where the pre-hyphen characters are the modifiers Ctrl, Alt, Shift
                      and Release event (instead of press).
          Key can be also ASCII character or one of enter, esc, bs, delete,
             up, down, left, right, home, end, pageup, pagedown, insert,
                             f1..f12, mouse0..mouse9.
                 Mouse buttons are numbered according to freeglut,
it would be 0 left, 1 center, 2 right, 3/4 vertical wheel, 5/6 horizontal wheel, ...

The event can also be mouse axis with specified modifiers and mouse buttons pressed:
               <[c][a][s]-mouse[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9](x|y)>.
                    At least one mouse button has to be pressed.
                     In this case the command has to contain %,
  which will be substitued by the mouse position difference in the axis in pixels
                            since the last command call.
  The command will be called on every mouse move with given modifiers and buttons.

                     The last option for the event is <idle>.
           This event occurs once in every frame without any other action
                (rotating, script execution, using console, ...),
                      idle event doesn't interrupt gf.sleep.
                    The mapped function can contain gf.sleep.

             If the second parameter is not recognized as a command,
                       it is treated as python expression.
                        No error is raised at this point.
