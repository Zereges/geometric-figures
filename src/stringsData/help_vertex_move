           vert[ex] move <coordinate1> [<coordinate2> [...]]

             Move the selected vertex by the given vector.
            Unspecified coordinates are considered to be 0.

              If convexhull is set, it is recalculated,
otherwise incident faces of lower dimension than the space are broken
                      to a simplex and the rest.
