                        rot[ate] <axis1> <axis2> <angle>

Rotate figure around the origin in the plane of the axes by the specified angle.

                           The axes are indexed from 1.
                            Axis 1 goes to the right,
                                axis 2 goes up,
                    axis 3 and every next go to the camera.
                         The order of the axes matters.
                            The angle is in degrees.
